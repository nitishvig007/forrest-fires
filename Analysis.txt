Conclusion :

1. month showing most unpredictable trend with respect to temperature : August

2. The month that recorded highest windspeed : March / Feb /  April / June 

3. The month that recorded highest rainfall : August

4. value of (X, Y) for maximum temperature : [6, 5]

5. Relationship between DC and DMC : Increasing (Positive Correaltion)

6. Since fires are majorly caused due to temperature and wind, so in Scenario 1 we are trying to predict temp and wind, based on prevoius data.
	We got accuracy 75% and 14% respectively.	

7. Since fires are caused in selective months, so in Scenario 2 we are trying to predict month, based on prevoius data
	We got 97% accuracy
